## What is Blockchain?
Think of a blockchain as a digital chain made up of blocks, with each block containing a list of transactions. These blocks are connected sequentially, forming a chronological chain. What makes blockchain unique is that this chain is copied across many computers, creating a decentralised network. Once a transaction is added to a block and included in the chain, it is permanent and cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks. This permanence is ensured through a consensus mechanism, which ensures that all participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions before they are accepted into the blockchain.

Here is a simplified diagram:

## How does blockchain work?
1. A user initiates a transaction, such as transferring cryptocurrency, recording ownership of digital assets, or executing a smart contract.
2. The transaction is broadcasted to the network of nodes (computers) participating in the blockchain network.
3. Nodes in the network validate the transaction's authenticity and ensure the sender has the necessary funds or permissions to execute the transaction.
4. Validated transactions are grouped into a block. Each block typically contains multiple transactions.
5. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a process called mining. This process varies depending on the consensus mechanism used, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
6. Once a miner successfully solves the puzzle, the new block is added to the existing blockchain.
7. The newly added block is validated by other nodes in the network, ensuring consensus on the validity of transactions.
8. The updated blockchain is propagated to all nodes in the network, ensuring that each node has an identical copy of the ledger.

## Key features of Blockchain
### Decentralisation
Blockchain operates on a decentralised network of computers, eliminating the need for a central authority and enabling peer-to-peer transactions. This feature promotes trust, transparency, and censorship resistance.

### Immutability
Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be altered or deleted. This feature ensures the integrity and security of transactions and data, making blockchain suitable for applications requiring tamper-proof records.

### Security
Blockchain employs cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one, and consensus mechanisms ensure that only valid transactions are added to the blockchain, protecting against fraud and unauthorized access.

### Transparency
Blockchain provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions. Since the ledger is distributed across multiple nodes, anyone with access to the blockchain can view transaction history, enhancing accountability and trust in the system. 

## Applications of Blockchain
### Cryptocurrencies
Blockchain technology is best known for enabling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These digital currencies leverage blockchain to facilitate secure and decentralised peer-to-peer transactions, allowing users to send and receive funds without the need for intermediaries like banks.

### Supply Chain Management
Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains by providing a decentralised and immutable record of product movements from the point of origin to the end consumer. This helps in preventing fraud, counterfeiting, and ensuring the authenticity of products.

### Decentralised Finance (DeFi)
DeFi refers to the use of blockchain technology to recreate traditional financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and asset management in a decentralised manner.

### Identity Management
Blockchain-based identity management solutions offer secure and decentralised ways to verify and manage digital identities.

### Voting Systems
Blockchain technology can enhance the transparency, security, and integrity of voting systems by providing a tamper-proof and auditable record of votes. Blockchain-based voting platforms enable secure and verifiable elections, reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.
