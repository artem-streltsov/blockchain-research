## Introduction
From static Web1 pages to the interactive platforms of Web2, the internet has evolved dramatically. With its core principles of decentralisation and user empowerment, Web3 offers a new vision for the future of online interaction

## Web1: Read-Only
Web1, the early stage of the World Wide Web, laid the foundation for today's internet landscape. Spanning from the 1990s to the early 2000s, it introduced millions to sharing information online.

### Key characteristics of Web1:
1. Predominantly static HTML pages with text, images, and basic formatting. Users consumed information passively.
2. Limited Interactivity. Minimal engagement beyond browsing static content, with basic online forms being the primary interactive feature.

## Web2: Read-Write
Web2 represents a transformative shift, fostering dynamic, interactive platforms and user-driven content creation.

### Key characteristics of Web2:
1. User-Generated Content. Empowers users to create and share content through platforms like blogs, wikis, and social media.
2. Social Media. Enables real-time communication, connection, and sharing through features like user profiles, news feeds, and likes/dislikes.
3. Collaboration. Leverages collective intelligence and creativity through collaborative platforms like Wikipedia.

Web2 revolutionised the internet, transitioning from static information to dynamic interaction, shaping an interconnected digital ecosystem.

## Web3: Read-Write-Own
Web3 marks the evolution of the Internet towards enhanced privacy, security, and user autonomy.

### Key characteristics of Web3:
1. Decentralisation. Web3 embraces decentralisation, eliminating reliance on centralised authorities. Blockchain technology enables transparent transaction recording, empowering users with control over data and digital assets via decentralised applications (dApps) and protocols.
2. Permissionless. Everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
3. Trustless. It operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.
4. Privacy and Security. Prioritises user privacy and security, offering greater control over personal data and digital identity.

Web3 represents a transformative shift towards a more decentralised, interconnected, and secure internet, empowering users with greater autonomy and control over their online experiences.

## Why is Web3 important?
### Ownership
In Web3, owning digital assets is more secure. For example, in a Web2 game, if you buy an in-game item, it's tied to your account. But if the creators delete your account, you lose the items and your investment.

However, in Web3, you directly own items through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). No one, not even the game creators, can take away your ownership. If you quit playing, you can still sell or trade your items on open markets and get back their value.

### Cencorship resistance
In Web2 music streaming services, artists are vulnerable to sudden policy changes that can impact their earnings and visibility. Conversely, Web3 decentralised music platforms offer censorship resistance, allowing artists to maintain ownership and control over their music. This ensures they can't be easily censored or removed by centralized authorities, safeguarding their income and artistic integrity.

### Native payments
In Web2 e-commerce platforms, payment processing typically involves intermediaries like banks. However, this system can exclude individuals without access to traditional banking services or those in regions with limited financial infrastructure.

In contrast, Web3 utilizes native tokens such as cryptocurrency to facilitate direct peer-to-peer payments. By bypassing traditional financial institutions, Web3 enables frictionless transactions that are accessible to anyone with internet access, regardless of their banking status or geographic location.

### Voting
Web3 can make voting safer and more transparent. With cryptography and smart contracts, votes are secure and fraud-resistant. Online voting from any device boosts accessibility and lowers costs.

## Limitations of Web 3
### User experience
Web3 is difficult to use due to its technical complexity. Users must decipher technical jargon, and navigate confusing interfaces. Although wallet providers are working on solutions, more progress is needed for widespread adoption.

### Scalability
Some Web3 platforms struggle with scalability, resulting in slow transaction processing times and high fees during periods of network congestion.

## Conclusion
Web3 represents a promising evolution of the internet, prioritizing decentralisation and user empowerment. Despite challenges, it has a substantial potential to create a more inclusive and secure online environment.
